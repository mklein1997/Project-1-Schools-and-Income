# Project 1: Comparing School Rankings vs. Income Per Capita in the Southeast United States.

 In this project, our team used Python, Pandas, Gmaps, and API calls to gather data on school rankings and income information for counties/school districts in several Southeastern states.
 
Using SchoolDigger API, data on school ratings across the Southeast was gathered into a Jupyter Notebook. Using the Pandas module, our team cleaned the data for analysis.
Data concerning income information was provided by the US Census. Income data was used at the county level, in order to match up as closely as possible with the school district level information used for the school data component. 

Once the data was cleaned and joined, analyses were run to make comparisons between income per capita and school districts.

Our findings concluded that these two metrics are not as closely correlated as we hypothesized.
